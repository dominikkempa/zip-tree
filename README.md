C++ Implementation of Zip Trees
===============================


Description
-----------

C++ implementation of balanced binary search trees called Zip
Trees. The data structure was described in the following paper

Compilation and usage
---------------------

The package contains the implementation and the correctness tests of
two variants of Zip Trees: one with, and one without the parent
pointer.  Additionally, the version with the parent pointer is
benchmarked against Red-Black trees from the STL library. Instructions
on how to compile and run the code for each of the version of the tree
are found in the README files in the specific directories in the src/
folder.
